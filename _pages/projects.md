**Interacting Real World and Digital Twins for Wireless Beamforming**
<img style="border:2px solid black;" align="right" width="40%" src="/images/Multiverse.png">
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">Creating a digital world that closely mimics the real world with its many complex interactions and outcomes is possible today through advanced emulation software and ubiquitous computing power. Such a software-based emulation of an entity that exists in the real world is called a ‘digital twin’. In this paper, we consider a twin of a wireless millimeter- wave band radio that is mounted on a vehicle and show how it speeds up directional beam selection in mobile environments. To achieve this, we go beyond instantiating a single twin and propose the ‘Multiverse’ paradigm, with several possible digital twins attempting to capture the real world at different levels of fidelity. Towards this goal, this paper describes (i) a decision strategy at the vehicle that determines which twin must be used given the computational and latency limitations, and (ii) a self- learning scheme that uses the Multiverse-guided beam outcomes to enhance DL-based decision-making in the real world over time. Our work is distinguished from prior works as follows: First, we use a publicly available RF dataset collected from an autonomous car for creating different twins. Second, we present a framework with continuous interaction between the real world and Multiverse of twins at the edge, as opposed to a one- time emulation that is completed prior to actual deployment. Results reveal that Multiverse offers up to 79.43% and 85.22% top-10 beam selection accuracy for LOS and NLOS scenarios, respectively. Moreover, we observe 52.72 − 85.07% improvement in beam selection time compared to 802.11ad standard.</div>

**Digital Twin Assisted Robot Navigation and WIreless Network Management**
<img style="border:2px solid black;" align="right" width="40%" src="/images/Multiverse.png">
<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">Automated warehouses involve robots that move across the floor, avoiding obstacles while remaining connected wirelessly to a central controller by associating with an access point (AP). The complex propagation environment and presence of large metallic surfaces results in spotty coverage, which may change over time as the location of stored products and machinery changes. Thus, maintaining an assured connectivity to an AP while performing navigation tasks is a challenge, although it is needed to relay local sensor data from the robots to the controller and receive safety directions from the latter. Our proposed solution, called DARWIN, involves creating a digital twin of the warehouse for training the robots by jointly optimizing the navigation tasks and avoiding wireless signal deadspots. DARWIN has three key capabilities: First, it captures the features of both the physical and RF environment in software, which can be used to generate synthetic datasets. Second, it allows real-time updating of the digital twin if significant disparity is detected compared to the physical environment. Finally, it includes a reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly optimizes navigation and network resource management. We show how DARWIN can be used to train a reinforcement learning model for handover among APs.</div>
